<div class="About">
	<p> I am Walid Noori, a third-year student of faculty of computer science at the university of Debrecen, born in 1996.<br> <br>
I am proud to have been honoured from all of my academic grades as a privilege (TOP) with awards, certificates and high scores. I really love learning languages, have mastered English and achieved IELTS band 7 about 4 years ago. I speak Urdu and currently learning German, <br> <br>
I started off learning front-end web development and got quite enough knowledge of these incredible technologies including HTML&CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and couple of JavaScript frameworks (Angular.js, React.js, Vue.js). And really looking forward to move on to back-end web development and explore more great technologies to able to create outstanding looking websites and applications.  <br> <br><b>
Live ambitiously with great thoughts and positive mindset, either win or learn.
